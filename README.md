# Mapping_Earthquakes

# Overview
As a data analyst for Basil and Sadhana, I have been tasked with visualzing earthquake data in relation to the tectonic platesâ€™ location on the earth. They also requested  to see all the earthquakes with a magnitude greater than 4.5 on the map, as well as data on a third map.
